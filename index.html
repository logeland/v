         Led through the mist, by the milk-light of moon. All that was lost is revealed. Our long bygone burdensm ere echoes of the spring, but where have we come? And where shall we end? If dreams can't come true, then why not pretend? How the gentle wind beckons through the leaves, as autumn colors fall dancing in a swirl of golden memories. The loveliest lies of all.
